* GDB Graphical Interface for GNU Emacs
This package provides a *graphical interface* to the *GDB debugger*. It is intended to be *fast* and
*intuitive*.

[[file:assets/screenshot.png]]

It was made as a drop-in replacement for the builtin package [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/GDB-Graphical-Interface.html][gdb-mi]] (check [[#why-rewrite][this question]] for the reason
behind rewriting the entire package from scratch).

** Features
- Fast :: Instead of parsing the GDB/MI output in Elisp, I've created a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Dynamic-Modules.html][dynamic module]] in C, which makes
          it run *fast like a bullet*!

- Easy to use :: The keybindings, which were inspired by *Visual Studio* and *Qt Creator*, were chosen to
                 be *easy to memorize* and to provide the best interaction possible without much putting
                 much strain on your fingers.

- Does what you meant :: Each command tries its best to infer what you meant when you run them.

- Organized :: You can change which buffer is displayed in each window, and even pop buffers to their own
               separate frames!

- Simultaneous sessions :: You can debug multiple programs at the same time, with different GDB sessions;
     each session creates its own frame.

- Debug remotely :: You may debug programs remotely over TRAMP!

*** List of special buffers
- Threads
- Stack frames
- Breakpoints
- Automatic variables
- Watchers
- Registers
- Disassembly (of the selected stack frame)
- Inferior I/O
- GDB command shell (please read [[#gdb-commands][this question]] before going crazy!)
** Interested? Here's the quick-start guide!
*** Dependencies
- *GCC* or *Clang* to compile the dynamic module
  - The module is /automatically/ compiled as soon as possible

- *GDB* (surprise, surprise) is needed to debug programs; I've only tested version 8.2, but will probably
  work on older ones

- Emacs package *Hydra* is needed for the buffer switcher

*** Package installation
This package intentionally uses the name ~gdb-mi~ in order to shadow the builtin package, as it could be
confusing to have two packages with the same purpose installed.

The easiest way to install it is by using [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][Quelpa]], which builds the packages for you from any source you
want.

In order to install, give Quelpa the following package recipe:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
'(gdb-mi :fetcher git
         :url "https://github.com/weirdNox/emacs-gdb.git"
         :files ("*.el" "*.c" "*.h" "Makefile"))
#+END_SRC

It is *highly recommended* that you delete the autoloaded definitions from the builtin package in order
to prevent confusion:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(fmakunbound 'gdb)
(fmakunbound 'gdb-enable-debug)
#+END_SRC

Here is an example configuration using ~use-package~:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package gdb-mi :quelpa (gdb-mi :fetcher git
                                    :url "https://github.com/weirdNox/emacs-gdb.git"
                                    :files ("*.el" "*.c" "*.h" "Makefile"))
  :init
  (fmakunbound 'gdb)
  (fmakunbound 'gdb-enable-debug))
#+END_SRC

*** Smash those bugs!
After the installation is complete, you may start a debugging session.

If you want to debug an executable, run ~gdb-executable~. You may also use this command to change the
executable being debugged.

If you want another type of target, you may try running ~gdb-create-session~ and then inserting the
commands manually in the shell buffer. I've not tested this, so I don't know how well it works.

** Default keybindings
The main way to interact with this package is by using the global minor mode ~gdb-keys-mode~, which
enables the usual keybindings you expect in a debugger, inspired by Visual Studio and Qt Creator:

** FAQ
*** Why rewrite the already existing package that comes with Emacs? @@html:<a name="why-rewrite">@@
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: why-rewrite
:END:
There are many things that led to my decision of rewriting ~gdb-mi~:
- When I wanted to use it, I ended up having to modify and rewrite many functions in order to have
  predictable functionality

- In some cases, the parsing would be so slow that I could not use it at all (when disassembling a big
  function and then stepping, for example)

- It felt weird that it changed all my windows instead of opening in a new frame

- Other reasons I've forgotten

- I like C, Elisp, and a good challenge: I couldn't find a package that used dynamic modules and it
  seemed like the perfect chance to do something I would use, as I couldn't find a debugger for Linux
  that I could say I liked.

*** Why use this interface instead of [insert Linux graphical debugger here]?
Well, if you use Emacs, both this and the builtin package are great because you never need to leave the
environment you use the rest of the day.

If you don't use Emacs (but are willing to try it) and you can't find a good graphical debugger for
Linux, this could be it!

If you are already happy with what you have, then there isn't much to see here. ☺

*** May I send custom GDB commands?@@html:<a name="gdb-commands">@@
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: gdb-commands
:END:
You may send any GDB command you want.

/However/, keep in mind that if:
- the command does not use the background form (eg. ~continue&~), it *will block GDB* until it finishes
  what it is doing, so you won't be able to interact with it! If you want to interrupt it, run
  ~comint-interrupt-subjob~ in the command shell buffer (bound to @@html:<kbd>@@ C-c C-c @@html:</kbd>@@).

- the command does not cause GDB to notify the interface of the changes it made, the interface may become
  out of sync and start giving errors

** Other information
- This package uses the library [[https://github.com/brasko/gdbwire][GDBWIRE]] for parsing the GDB/MI output.
- The original Emacs GDB interface was my main inspiration, so thanks Nick Roberts!
