* GDB Graphical Interface for GNU Emacs
This package provides a *graphical interface* to the *GDB debugger*. It is intended to be *fast* and
*intuitive*.

It was made as a drop-in replacement for the builtin package [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/GDB-Graphical-Interface.html][gdb-mi]] (check [[#why-rewrite][this question]] for the reason
behind rewriting the entire package from scratch).

** Other information
- This package uses the library [[https://github.com/brasko/gdbwire][GDBWIRE]] for parsing the GDB/MI output.
- The original Emacs GDB interface was my main inspiration, so thanks Nick Roberts!
